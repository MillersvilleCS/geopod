  <h1>Main Geopod Page</h1>

  <p>(To be filled in later)</p>

  <p>Below is a link to mission control. This should ultimately be in
    a tab on the main page, or in a box off to the side, explaining what
    mission building is, having a link to register and the link below,
    which takes you to the login page (if you aren't already logged in)
    and then to the dashboard page</p>

    <!--  GMZ: Here's how this is usually done -->
    <a href="javascript:goToMissionControl ()">Mission
      Control</a>
    <!-- or this 
    <a href="#" onclick="goToMissionControl ()">Mission Control</a>
    -->
