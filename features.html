					<span class="headingStyle">Interface Overview</span>
					<p>The Geopod interface was carefully designed to be simple and
						intuitive, presenting necessary features with a minimum of
						distraction. The main parts of the Geopod interface are described
						below.</p>

					<span class="headingStyle">Navigation</span>
					<p>Geopod is all about flying inside the atmosphere to explore
						meteorological phenomena, so it’s important for users to be able
						to understand where they are and easily get where they want to be.
						Fortunately, Geopod provides a wide range of navigational
						instruments to help users pilot effectively.</p>
					<hr>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Key and Mouse Navigation</span>
					<p>
						Most navigation in Geopod is done with video-game like key and
						mouse controls. The traditional WSAD keys are used for forward,
						backward, left and right movement, with additional keys used to
						pitch, roll and yaw. Other keys are shortcuts to useful locations.
						For example, <b>R</b> resets the Geopod to its starting position
						above the data volume while <b>T</b> positions Geopod in a
						top-down view over the data volume. Two varieties of rotation are
						available with the mouse: click and drag rotation with the left
						mouse button and continuous rotation with the right mouse button,
						allowing users to select the behavior that works best for them.
					</p>
					<hr>

					<div class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Autopilot and Lat/Lon/Alt
							Display</span> <br /> <img class="RightAlignedImage topImage"
							title="Lat/Lon/Alt control shows current position"
							alt="Lat/Lon/Alt control Image"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodLatLonAlt.png"><br />
						The Lat/Lon/Alt display allows Geopod users to always see exactly
						where they are in the atmosphere, and can also be combined with
						the Autopilot feature to take the Geopod to an exact location.
						Simply enter the location you want in the Lat/Lon/Alt boxes and
						click “GO” to be flown anywhere. This is particularly useful for
						returning to interesting locations, or directing students to
						locations where they will observe particular atmospheric
						conditions.
					</div>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Geocoding (forward and
							reverse)</span> <br /> <br />Geopod leverages Google’s geocoding
						capabilities to help users connect positions in the atmosphere to
						locations on the political map. <img class="LeftAlignedImage"
							title="Geocode control showing geographic location"
							alt="Geocode Image"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodGeocode.png">Using
						forward geocoding, Geopod users can to determine the city, state
						or country over which Geopod is currently positioned. Reverse
						geocoding, used in conjunction with the autopilot feature, allows
						users to type in a place name and then fly there.
					</p>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img class="RightAlignedImage" title="Isosurface with Flight Path"
							alt="Isosurface Image showing Flight Path"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodIsosurfacePath.png"> <span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Isosurface Lock</span><br /> <br />
						The isosurface lock helps users explore the relationships between
						various atmospheric parameters. This feature allows users to “lock
						on” to and fly along an isosurface, where they can use the
						parameter display panel to observe how some parameters change
						while the isosurface parameter maintains a constant value. While
						users are locked on, their flight path is painted along the
						surface so that afterward they can see exactly where they've been.
					</p>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Mini-map</span><br /> <br /> <img
							class="LeftAlignedImage topImage"
							title="Mini-map (yellow triangle is Geopod's position)"
							alt="Image of Geopod Mini-map"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodMinimap.png">The
						Mini-map lets users easily see where they are in relation to the
						rest of the world. Located in the upper left-hand corner of the
						screen, the Mini-map displays a map of the world with a marker
						indicating the Geopod’s current position. This is especially
						useful if you are exploring a complicated isosurface and have lost
						sight of the earth’s surface.
					</p>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Compass</span> <img
							class="RightAlignedImage" title="Compass"
							alt="Image of Geopod Compass"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodCompass.png"><br /> <br />Geopod’s
						compass allows users to determine their heading and makes it easy
						to follow directions like “fly northeast…”
					</p>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Attitude Indicator</span><br /> <img
							class="LeftAlignedImage" title="Attitude Indicator"
							alt="Image of Geopod Attitude Indicator"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodAttitudeIndicator.png">
						<br /> This instrument measures the pitch and roll of the Geopod
						and allows users to quickly determine if they are aligned with the
						earth’s surface. The indicator was designed to be easy to read at
						a glance. If the red line is in the brown area, Geopod is pitched
						downward, if the red line is in blue area (as shown), Geopod is
						pitched upward, and if the red line is exactly between the two
						areas, Geopod is level with the surface.
					</p>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img class="RightAlignedImage indentRightSmall"
							title="Speed Control" alt="Image of Geopod Speed Control"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodSpeedControl.png"><span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Speed Control</span> <br /> <br />
						With this instrument, users can adjust the speed at which Geopod
						flies as they navigate through the atmosphere. This way, users can
						move very slowly to investigate the effects small changes in
						position have on atmospheric conditions, or very quickly to cover
						large distances to reach an area of interest.

				<div id=devices>
					<span class="headingStyle">Devices</span>
					<p>In addition to isosurface and parameter display, Geopod
						provides a number of useful devices that facilitate and enhance
						student’s exploration of the atmosphere. These devices allow
						students to gather additional data about atmospheric conditions or
						view existing information in different ways.</p>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img
							class="RightAlignedImage indentRightLarge indentLeftSmall topImage"
							title="Dropsonde Vertical Profile"
							alt="Image of Geopod Dropsonde"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodDropsonde.png"> <span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Dropsonde</span> <br /> <br />This
						device allows Geopod users to see a vertical profile of the
						atmosphere at their current latitude and longitude. Users can view
						graphs of temperature, dewpoint, relative humidity, u wind and v
						wind plotted against pressure or, if they prefer, altitude. Geopod
						maintains a customizable history of launched dropsondes which
						users can cycle through to see how the graphs change at different
						locations.

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Particle Imager</span> <br /> <br />
						<img class="LeftAlignedImage topImage"
							title="Particle Imager indicating Sectored Plates formation"
							alt="Image of Geopod Particle Imager"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodParticleImager.png">The
						Particle Imager helps users explore the effects of temperature and
						relative humidity on particle formation by displaying images of
						the particles that could form under the conditions at their
						current location. This device updates continuously; a changed
						image alerts users that they have moved to a location with
						different particle formation. Users can cycle also through several
						particle images within the same particle formation category.
					</p>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img class="RightAlignedImage topImage indentRightSmall"
							title="Distance Calculator"
							alt="Image of Geopod Distance Calculator"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodDistanceMeasurer.png"><span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Distance Calculator</span><br /> <br />The
						Distance Calculator measures the straight-line distance between a
						starting point and the Geopod’s current location. Updating
						continuously as the Geopod moves, this device ensures that users
						can always see how far away they are from when they started and
						evaluate changes in parameter values accordingly.
					</p>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Notepad and Note Location
							System</span><br /> <br /> <img class="LeftAlignedImage topImage"
							title="Notepad showing Noted Locations"
							alt="Image of Geopod Notepad"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodNotepad.png"> <img
							class="RightAlignedImage topImage bottomImage indentRightSmall"
							title="Note Location Prompt"
							alt="Image of Geopod Note Location Prompt"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodNoteLocationPrompt.png">The
						Note Location System allows users to keep track of interesting
						locations as they fly through the atmosphere. “Noting” a location
						saves its lat, lon and alt along with the values of all the
						parameters in the parameter display panel and an optional comment
						in the Notepad. Users can later open the Notepad to see their
						noted locations and add additional comments. The Notepad serves as
						a mini-text editor: users can edit their notes, save them in a
						.txt file, and open other .txt files from previous sessions all
						inside Geopod.

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img class="RightAlignedImage topImage"
							title="Gridpoints displayed in Geopod"
							alt="Image of Geopod Gridpoints"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodGridpoints.png"><span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Gridpoint Visualizer</span><br /> <br />Geopod
						and IDV use 3D gridded data sets, which means that data from
						certain points in the atmosphere is interpolated to provide
						information for every location in the data volume. The Gridpoint
						visualizer helps users to understand this underlying dataset by
						showing the locations where actual data was given. Using the
						autopilot, users can easily fly to any of these gridpoints and see
						the actual conditions there.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Flight Data Recorder and
						Flight Playback</span>
					<p>The Flight Data Recorder allows users to maintain a record
						of their flight path and the activities, like launching dropsondes
						and noting locations, that they have performed at various
						locations. Then with the Flight Playback feature, users can be
						automatically taken back through their movements and activities to
						review exactly what took place during their exploration of the
						atmosphere.</p>

				<div id=additionalFeatures>
					<span class="headingStyle">Additional Features</span>
					<p>In addition to navigational instruments and the devices
						described above, Geopod provides several additional systems that
						provide advanced features and allow users to customize their
						experience.</p>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Parameter Chooser</span> <br /> <br />
						<img class="LeftAlignedImage topImage" title="Parameter Chooser"
							alt="Image of Geopod Parameter Chooser"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodParameterChooser.png">The
						parameter chooser lets users decide which parameters they want
						Geopod to display and update as they navigate through the
						atmosphere. Users can select up to 19 of the over 50 parameters
						available, ensuring that they have just the right information to
						explore whatever meteorological concepts they choose.
					</p>
					<hr>

					<p class="featuresEntry">
						<img class="RightAlignedImage topImage indentRightLarge"
							title="Isosurface Display"
							alt="Image of Geopod Isosurface Display"
							src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodIsosurfaceDisplay.png"><span
							class="minorHeadingStyle">Isosurface Display</span><br /> <br />This
						feature makes it easy to view, adjust, and remove the 3D
						isosurfaces displayed in Geopod. Users can see what parameter was
						used to create each isosurface, determine what constant value of
						that parameter is being shown, change the parameter value, remove
						the isosurface completely, or use a shortcut to the IDV interface
						where they can access more advanced isosurface manipulation
						options.
