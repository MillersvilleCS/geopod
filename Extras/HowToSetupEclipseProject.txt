How to Setup Eclipse Project

o Check out Geopod "trunk" as a New Java project (if using Subclipse)

o If Java 3D is not installed, do the following for Arch Linux. For Windows use the installer.

  $ yaourt -S java3d
  ... Edit PKGBUILD ? [Y/n] ("A" to abort) 
  => n
  ... Continue building java3d ? [Y/n] 
  => Y
  ... Continue installing java3d ? [Y/n] 
  => Y

o Add the Java 3D jars (core, util, vecmath) to the build path (libraries tab) if they 
  are not there already.

o Add the following libraries to the build path. They are all in the Libraries folder.	

  Right click on Libraries and go to Build path -> configure path

  A '*' indicates an omitted (irrelevant) version number.
  Note: to add multiple jar files at once, single click on one
	jar file. Hold CRTL and click more packages.

	gson-#.jar 
	guava-r#.jar
	auxdata.jar, external.jar, idv.jar, jython.jar, 
	  local-visad.jar, ncIdv.jar, visad.jar
	miglayout-#.jar
	swingx-1.6.jar
	TimingFramework-#.jar
	xstream-#.jar
	xpp3_min-#.jar
	
	replace # with the current version number. Be sure to only include 
	the *.jars mentioned above.
	
o Export General->Ant Buildfiles as build.xml

  Right click on Geopod directory in package explorer and
    go to export -> Ant Buildfiles
  Make sure build.xml is in the 'Name for Ant buildfile'
    field.
  Finish.
  
  NOTE: if you later make any changes to the java build path, 
  		you will need to repeat this step

o Set up a run configuration under Run -> run configuration

	Type: Java Application
	Name: IDV with Geopod
	Main class: ucar.unidata.idv.IntegratedDataViewer
	
	Under arguments	
	Program arguments: -plugin ./Geopod.jar
	VM arguments: -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
	
o Use Ant tasks in userBuild.xml to build and run Geopod

  In the package explorer, right click on userBuild.xml and
    select Ant build.
