						Geopod is open source and freely available for download. To get
						started using Geopod, follow the steps below. Please keep in mind
						that Geopod still in the testing stage. If you encounter any
						problems, feel free to <a href="./contactUs.html">contact us</a>.
					</p>
					<p>Geopod is available for Windows and Linux platforms.
						Unfortunately, Geopod is not compatible with Mac at this time.
						This is because Apple does not currently provide a package for
						Java3D, which Geopod requires for 3D rendering. If the Java3D
						package is provided some time in the future, Geopod will likely
						become available for Mac.</p>

					<p>
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Requirements</span> <br />Please
						ensure your computer meets the following requirements before
						installing Geopod:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Windows (XP/Vista/7/8) or Linux platform</li>
						<li>Minimum 2 GB memory</li>
						<li>Minimum 1366 x 768 screen resolution</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						<span class="headingStyle">Step 1: Install IDV</span> <br />Geopod
						is a plugin for the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV), so before you
						can use Geopod you must have IDV installed on your computer. IDV
						versions 3.0u2 and 3.1u1 are supported. Older or more recent
						versions may not be fully compatible with Geopod. You can visit
						the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv">IDV
							website</a> to learn more about installing IDV.

					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="headingStyle">Step 2: Run IDV Once</span> <br />If
						you are already an IDV user and have not just installed a new
						version of IDV, you may skip this step.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have just installed IDV, it is important that you run it
						once so that it can create the necessary <i>.unidata</i> folder in
						your home directory. The <span class="<i>.unidata</i>">.unidata</span>
						folder is a hidden folder, so you will not normally see it, but
						IDV needs to create it so it can store data needed for plugins
						like Geopod.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="headingStyle">Step 3: Install Geopod</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle italicized">For Windows
							users:</span> <br /> Download the following install script: <a
							href="./plugins/Scripts/InstallGeopod.exe">InstallGeopod
							(EXE)</a> then right click and choose <span class="bold">run
							as administrator</span>. This will update the necessary parts of IDV
						with the files from this website and install the latest version of
						the Geopod plugin. Note that InstallGeopod is an <i>.exe</i> file
						so some antivirus software may generate warnings when you download
						it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The install script will need to locate IDV’s <i>.unidata</i>
						folder in order to install Geopod. If the <i>.unidata</i> folder
						cannot be located automatically, you will be prompted to find
						manually it using the file chooser provided. The <i>.unidata</i>
						folder is typically in your home directory, that is, the folder
						with the name of your account that is located under <i>Users</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">If you encounter problems: </span> If for some
						reason the install script does not work, you can manually replace
						the necessary files as follows:
					</p>
					<ol class="letters">
						<li>Locate the IDV program folder. This will typically be
							C:/Program Files/IDV_<i>VersionNumber</i> unless you chose a
							different folder when you installed IDV.
						</li>
						<li>Download <a href="./plugins/Patch/runIDV.bat">runIDV.bat
								(Windows Batch File)</a>and use it to replace the runIDV.bat file in
							the IDV program folder. Note that if your computer hides file
							extensions (which it does by default) there will appear to be
							several files called ‘runIDV’ in the IDV program folder. Be sure
							to replace the one which is of type Windows Batch File.
						</li>
						<li>Download <a href="./plugins/Patch/local-visad.jar">local-visad.jar
								(Executable Jar File)</a> and use it to replace the local-visad.jar
							file in the IDV program folder.
						</li>
						<li>Locate your <i>.unidata</i> folder. This is typically in
							your home directory, that is, the folder with the name of your
							account that is located under <i>Users</i>. If you cannot find
							the <i>.unidata</i> folder and have just installed IDV, make sure
							you have run IDV at least once.
						</li>
						<li>Download the latest <a href="./plugins/GeopodPlugin.jar">Geopod
								Plugin (Executable Jar File)</a> and place it in the <i>.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/plugins</i>
							folder.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						<span class="bold">For system administrators: </span> If you are
						installing Geopod in a classroom setting where Geopod users do not
						have the administrator privileges needed to run the install
						script, use the following alternative:

					</p>
					<ol class="letters">
						<li>Run the <a href="./plugins/Script/PatchIDV.exe">PatchIDV
								Script (EXE)</a> as administrator on all computers where IDV is
							installed to replace the necessary IDV files.
						</li>
						<li>Have individual Geopod users run the <a
							href="./plugins/Scripts/UpdateGeopod.exe">Geopod Update
								Script (EXE)</a>, which does not require administrator privileges,
							to install the Gepod plugin to their local <i>.unidata</i>
							folder.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle italicized">For Linux users:</span>
						<br /> Download and run the following script: <a
							href="./plugins/Patch/InstallGeopod.sh">InstallGeopod.sh
							(shell script)</a>. This will update the necessary parts of IDV with
						the files from this website, as well as install the Geopod plugin.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="bold">If you encounter problems: </span> If you
						encounter problems with the script, you can install Geopod
						manually as follows:
					</p>
					<ol class="letters">
						<li>Locate the IDV program folder. This will typically be <i>YourHomeDirectory</i>/IDV_<i>VersionNumber</i>
							unless you chose a different location when you installed IDV.
						</li>
						<li>In the IDV program folder, locate the <i>runIDV</i>
							script file (not runIDV.bat) and open it in an editor. Make the
							appropriate edits as specified below, then save your changes.<br />
							<b>For IDV version 3.1 or later:</b> uncomment (remove two
							leading #'s) the line that sets <i>idv_maxpermgensize=128</i>. <br />
							<b>For older versions of IDV:</b> Locate the line that invokes
							the java JVM (starts with <i>java ...</i>). The line directly
							below this one will be commented out (have two #'s in front) and
							be nearly identical except that it contains the text <i>
								-XX:MaxPermSize=128m</i>. Uncomment (remove the two #'s in front of)
							this line and comment out (place two #'s in front of) the line
							above it.
						</li>
						<li>Download <a href="./plugins/Patch/local-visad.jar">local-visad.jar
								(Executable Jar File)</a> and use it to replace the local-visad.jar
							file in the IDV program folder.
						</li>
						<li>Download the latest <a href="./plugins/GeopodPlugin.jar">Geopod
								Plugin (Executable Jar File)</a> and place it in the
							~/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/plugins folder. If this folder does not
							exist, make sure you have run IDV at least once after installing.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<br />
					<p>
						<span class="headingStyle">Running Geopod</span> <br />Step-by
						step instructions for running Geopod from IDV are provided in the
						<a href="documents/GeopodQuickStartGuide.pdf">Geopod Quick
							Start Guide (PDF)</a>. For an overview of the interface and more
						detailed instructions on using individual features, refer to the <a

					<br />
					<p>
						<span class="headingStyle">Updating Geopod</span> <br />Geopod is
						frequently updated to include new features and bug fixes, so it’s
						a good idea to always make sure you are using the latest version.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle italicized">For Windows
							users:</span> <br /> To update to the latest version of Geopod,
						download and run the <a href="./plugins/Scripts/UpdateGeopod.exe">Geopod
							Update Script (EXE)</a>. The script will need to locate IDV’s <i>.unidata</i>
						folder in order to install Geopod. If the <i>.unidata</i> folder
						cannot be located automatically, you will be prompted to find
						manually it using the file chooser provided. The <i>.unidata</i>
						folder is typically in your home directory, that is, the folder
						with the name of your account that is located under <i>Users</i>.

					<p>
						<span class="bold">If you encounter problems: </span> If for some
						reason you have difficulty using the update script above, you can
						follow the instructions for Linux users below to manually replace
						your Geopod plugin with the latest version.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="minorHeadingStyle italicized">For Linux users:</span>
						<br /> Locate the <i>.unidata</i> folder in your home directory.
						Download the latest <a href="./plugins/GeopodPlugin.jar">Geopod
							Plugin (Executable Jar File)</a> and use it to replace the existing
						GeopodPlugin.jar file it in the <i>.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/plugins</i>
						folder.
