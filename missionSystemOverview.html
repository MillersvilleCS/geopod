				<p>Welcome to the Geopod Mission System. The Geopod Mission
					Builder allows you to create challenging, innovative missions to
					help your students learn exciting meteorological concepts. Geopod
					missions utilize the built-in mission feature in the Geopod plugin
					to bring assignments to students right in their exploration
					environment, enhancing the learning experience. The Mission System
					makes Geopod an exceptional classroom tool because mission
					instructions and assessments are conveniently available for your
					students right inside Geopod.</p>

				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">What is a mission?</span> <br /> A
					combination lab assignment and quiz that is specially designed to
					be used with Geopod, a mission consists of background material and
					specific assignment objectives, each with an assessment to evaluate
					student performance. Missions can be created using the online
					Mission Builder and then exported as <i>.geo</i> files which can be
					distributed to students, for example, sent via email, posted on a
					website, or placed in a shared folder. Students can load the <i>.geo</i>
					file into Geopod to view the mission and take assessments.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">How does a mission appear
						inside Geopod?</span> <br /> After students load a <i>.geo</i> mission
					file into Geopod, they will see two new tabs in Geopod’s Mission
					Panel: <i>Mission</i> and <i>Objectives</i>. The <span
						class="italicizedBold">Mission</span> tab will contain the
					mission’s background material, <img class=RightAlignedImage
						title="Objectives Tab in Geopod" alt="Geopod Objectives Tab Image"
						src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodObjectives.png"> which
					can include images and links as well as text. The <span
						class="italicizedBold">Objectives</span> tab will contain a list
					of the mission objectives; each objective is shown with a title,
					plain text description, and link to its assessment. Assessments for
					each objective can consist of <b>multiple choice</b> questions
					(both single answer and multiple answer) and <b>multi-dropdown</b>
					questions (like fill-in-the-blank, but each blank is a dropdown
					where an answer can be selected). Assessments are not timed, and
					students can view an assessment, return to the objectives list, and
					view other assessments with no penalty. Once an assessment is
					submitted, however, it cannot be retaken unless the mission is
					reloaded.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">How are assessments taken
						and scored?</span> <br /> When a mission is created, each potential
					answer to an assessment question is given a point value and marked
					as correct or not. The total point value for the question is the
					sum of the point values for all correct answers. This allows
					students to receive partial credit for some answers, even if they
					are not correct, or lose points for other answers. Unanswered
					questions are given a score of 0.
				</p>

				<p>
					When a student completes an assessment and clicks <i>submit</i>,
					Geopod calculates and reports the points earned out of the total
					number of points possible. Geopod does not reveal scores for
					individual questions or indicate which answers were correct, but
					instead generates an encrypted file (also with a <i>.geo</i>
					extension) with the student’s answers and places it on their
					desktop. Students can then submit their answers files to the
					instructor, for example, by emailing them or placing them in a
					folder in a shared location. Using the <b>Geopod Mission Grader
						application</b> (available for download soon), instructors can load
					the <i>.geo</i> files to see individual answers and overall scores
					for their students.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">How do I use the Mission
						System website?</span> <br /> To access the missions already written by
					other instructors or use the <img
						class="LeftAlignedImage bottomImage"
						title="Mission Assessment in Geopod"
						alt="Mission Assessment Image"
						src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodAssessment.png">Mission
					Builder to create your own, you will need to register for an
					instructor-level account using the link in the login area on the
					left. When you register, you will need to provide additional
					information to verify that you are an instructor and wait for
					approval before being able to log in. If you want to try out the
					Mission Builder without viewing missions created by other
					instructors, you can create a student account for immediate access.
					<br /> <b>Please Note: This mission site is currently under
						construction. No instructor accounts are accepted at this time.
						Please feel free to experiment with a student account, but any
						missions you create may be deleted.</b>
