					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">What is Geopod?</span> <br />
					Geopod is an open source, java-based plugin for the <a
						href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv">Integrated
						Data Viewer (IDV)</a>, a geoscience visualization software framework
					created by <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata</a>.
					Developed by the Computer Science and Earth Science departments at
					<a href="http://www.millersville.edu">Millersville University</a>
					through a National Science Foundation grant, Geopod is a learning
					tool designed to enhance undergraduate level earth science
					education by providing students and instructors with a novel and
					intuitive way to explore meteorological concepts. Geopod presents a
					new perspective and simplified interface for using some important
					features of traditional IDV, while including new features to
					enhance learning and facilitate classroom use.
				</p>


				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">How does Geopod help
						students learn?</span> <br /> Geopod changes how students interact with
					the meteorological data presented with IDV. Rather than simply
					viewing a 3D image on a 2D screen, Geopod users are immersed in a
					3D environment where they can navigate with video-game like
					controls, see atmospheric conditions at their current location, and
					use a variety of systems to gather additional data as they fly
					through the atmosphere. This unique, intuitive interaction style is
					designed to motivate students to explore the atmosphere and
					encourage them to learn meteorological concepts.
				</p>
				<p>
					As students explore the atmosphere, Geopod uses a variety of
					techniques to help them to understand and visualize atmospheric
					conditions. One of the most significant of these is depicting <span
						class="italicizedBold">isosurfaces</span> of various parameters
					which allow students to see all locations (as a 3D surface) where
					those parameters take on particular values. Geopod is capable of
					displaying isosurfaces for a variety of different parameters or for
					the same parameter at multiple values simultaneously. Rather than
					just viewing these isosurfaces from a distance, students can fly
					through them to investigate their appearance at close range.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, as students fly through the atmosphere to explore
					isosurfaces, Geopod’s continuously updating <span
						class="italicizedBold">parameter display panel</span> shows the
					current values of up to 19 different parameters. This allows
					students to investigate not just the shape of the isosurface, but
					its influence on and the interactions among many other parameters.
					<img class=LeftAlignedImage
						title="Parameter Display and Overflow Panels" alt="Geopod Image"
						src="./Images/HomePageImages/GeopodParameters.png"> To
					further enhance learning, the isosurface lock mechanism allows
					students to “lock on” to an isosurface and fly along the surface,
					observing how other parameters change while the one parameter
					remains constant.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the primary learning mechanisms of isosurface and
					parameter display, a variety of other features like the Dropsonde
					device, Particle Imager, Note Location system and many others help
					students gather data and learn meteorological concepts. See our <a
						href="./features.html">Features</a> page for more details.
				</p>
				<p>
					To facilitate student exploration and minimize time spent learning
					the software, Geopod’s interface was designed to be clean,
					easy-to-use, and accessible to novices and experts alike. In 2010
					we conducted a <a href="documents/GeopodUsabilityStudy.pdf">usability
						study (PDF)</a> to help us find and address any user difficulties, and
					we have been improving continuously ever since.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="minorHeadingStyle">Does Geopod present accurate
						atmospheric conditions?</span> <br /> Absolutely. The data used in
					Geopod for isosurface rendering, parameter display, and all other
					subsystems is authentic geophysical data taken from data sources
					loaded into IDV. As such it is based on actual physics, thus
					exhibiting technical accuracy and scientific soundness.
				</p>
